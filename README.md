# DopePlayer
Basic Python mp3 player using Guizero.
This was designed to work in Linux, haven't tried on windows.
This uses guizero, pygame, and the os module (you may need to download these with pip)
Python comes with pip after version 3.4

pip install guizero
pip install pygame
pip install os

This mp3 player only playes mp3 formats due to using pygame.
Currently the Pervious and Next buttons do not work. 
 -will fix this soon
